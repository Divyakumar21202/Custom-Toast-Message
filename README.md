## Introduction

The Custom Toast Example app showcases the process of creating a custom Toast with a unique layout and message. The default Android Toast is replaced with a personalized design to enhance user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Android Studio installed on your development machine.
- Basic understanding of Android app development and Java programming.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an Android emulator or physical device.
4. Upon launching the app, you will see a button labeled "Show Custom Toast."
5. Click the button to trigger the custom Toast display.
6. The custom Toast will appear at the top-right corner of the screen with the message "This is Custom Toast."

## Customization

You can customize the custom Toast according to your preferences. To modify the layout or behavior, follow these steps:

1. Open the `custom_toast_layout.xml` file in the `res/layout` directory.
2. Adjust the layout elements, colors, fonts, and positioning as desired.
3. In the `MainActivity.java` file, locate the `onClick` method of the button click listener.
4. Modify the `textView.setText("This is Custom Toast");` line to change the message displayed in the custom Toast.

```java
button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        View vie = getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.custom_toast_layout, (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.toast_layout_container));
        
        textView = vie.findViewById(R.id.txt_message);
        textView.setText("Your Custom Message Here"); // Modify this line
        
        // ... (remaining code)
    }
});
```

5. You can also adjust the Toast's duration and positioning by modifying the appropriate lines in the code.
